# TelegramScheduler
Telegram Bot that allows users to schedule for an activity during a certain date/time

To start of with the bot, few things should be done, the reason for these is to make sure that your data stays as your data, so its important for you to make your own Bot and Google Sheet so the information stays within that.
In Telegram, create your own bot that the code will run for:
  Use the @BotFather
  https://telegram.me/BotFather
  Then follow through with the instructions, use the following link for more details

You would then need to access the googlesheets and drive API for your project:

Use this tutorial for more clarity and to obtain the JSON credentials file that will be used for this project.

Make sure the file is added to your project folder, and then the filename can be copied to the creds file and then your Telegram Token can be copied to its spot aswell.

Then create a google sheet that you would like to reference to, make sure the names are exactly referenced.
